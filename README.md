### With robots advancing more and more towards working together with humans, the field of activity recognition becomes increasingly important as a key enabler for effective and acceptable human-robot interaction. Recently, different approaches have evolved that use diverse methodologies and algorithms to recognize human activities from sensor data like motion tracking information or RFID readings. We gathered all available datasets which aimed to capture a typical morning routine of a single person in an apartment and used machine learning algorithms in order to predict future activities of that person. At this stage we intent to help people with Alzheimer's disease to remind the possible sequence of daily activities.
